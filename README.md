# Dstr-Implementation : A Data Structure Implementation

## What's This?
It has data structure and some sorting implementations in several languages. Currently I wrote in C, C++, C# and Python. More languages such as Java, Go and more in future.

## Languages

### Available
* C
* C++
* C#
* Python

### In Future
* Go
* Java
* JavaScript
* Rust
* TypeScript
* Visual BASIC .NET

## Contents

### Sorting
* Bubble Sort
* Counting Sort
* Exchange Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort
* Shell Sort
* Tree Sort


### Tree
* Binary Search Tree (BST)
* AVL Tree

### Search
* Binary Search
* Binary Search - Lower Bound
* Binary Search - Upper Bound

### Data Structure
* Heap (Array based; Max and min heap)
* Stack (Linked List based)
* Queue (Linked List based)

## Upcoming Implementations
* Stack (Array Based)
* Linked List
* Double Linked List
* Deque (Linked List based)
* Radix Sort
* Linear Search
* Hash Table
* Binary Tree
* Tree (Ordinary)
* Interpolation Search
* Cocktail Shaker Sort
* Splay Tree
* Tim Sort
* Intro Sort
* Graph

## In Plan
* Block Merge Sort
* Sleep Sort
* Pancake Sort
* Slow Sort
* Random Quick Sort
