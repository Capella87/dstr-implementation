# Dstr-Implementation : A Data Structure Implementation

## What's This?
It has data structure and some sorting implementations in several languages. Currently I wrote in C, C++, C# and Python. More languages such as Java, Go and more in future.

## Languages

### Available
* C
* C++
* C#
* Python

### In Future
* Go

* Rust

## Contents

### Sorting
* Bubble Sort
* Counting Sort
* Exchange Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort

* Shell Sort
* Tree Sort


### Tree
* Binary Search Tree (BST)

### Search

### Data Structure
* Heap (Array based; Max and min heap)
* Stack (Linked List based)

## Upcoming Implementations
